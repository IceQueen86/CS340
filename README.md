Grasiozo_Salvare
Final project for CS-340 Client/Server Development SNHU

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Adopting a modular strategy when writing code improves both how easy it is to maintain and how clear it is to read. Rather than building one large, all-encompassing file with every function, class, and the main routine, it’s more effective to separate your code into individual files for each class. Each file can hold a class along with its related getter and setter methods. The main routine should be placed in its own file, and any utility functions can be grouped into libraries. With this setup, you can update or fix a single library, and any code that uses that library will automatically benefit from those changes.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I tend to begin projects by forming a comprehensive understanding of what needs to be created, using a requirements-focused, top-down strategy. This is in contrast to immediately coding individual parts from the bottom up. From experience, jumping straight into coding often results in having to redo work later, such as changing function parameters or modifying return types as the design evolves.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer Science covers a wide range of topics, but it generally includes two primary specialties: Software Development (or Coding) and Information Technology (IT). IT professionals typically work with physical hardware, such as building and maintaining computers or servers. In contrast, Software Development focuses on creating digital solutions—these products aren’t physical, but they perform specific functions to make tasks easier. For example, programmers might develop an application that helps a company efficiently search a database for suitable candidates for rescue training programs. This kind of software streamlines the screening process, making work more efficient and accessible. As a result, people in many different fields can benefit from these improvements and perform their jobs more effectively.
